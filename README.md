[Radio Galaxy Detection and Characterization in the Visibility Domain using Bayesian Inference](https://github.com/amalyali/RadioGalFit/wiki)

Python codes using [Multinest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest) for galaxy detection and [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)](https://github.com/tbs1980/MCMC-Performance-Primitives)
for galaxy shape measurement from raw inteferometric data. Both approches use [Montblanc](https://github.com/ska-sa/montblanc) tool for modelling visibilities and likelihood computation.
